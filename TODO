- Think of a name for the project! duh! (suggestions are welcome)
- Rename root CMakeLists.txt project name
- Remove self-signed certificates from VCS
- Fix GitHub actions for CI at least
- Add tests for the libraries with Googletest framework
- Add abstraction layer for the event system (at the moment using kqueue for BSD systems) and networking.
- Develop dynamic libraries runtime load for http handlers
- Refactor all the typedefs scattered along multiple headers
