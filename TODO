- Think of a name for the project! duh! (suggestions are welcome)
- In the future, separate project in multiple libraries with well defined layers (i.e:)
    * TcpServer (Lib)
    * WebServer (Lib)
    * ConsoleApp (Executable)
- Rename root CMakeLists.txt project name
- Remove self-signed certificates from VCS
- Fix GitHub actions for CI at least
- Add tests for the libraries with Googletest framework
- Add abstraction layer for the event system (at the moment using kqueue for BSD systems)
- Develop dynamic libraries runtime load for http handlers
- Refactor all the typedefs scattered along multiple headers
